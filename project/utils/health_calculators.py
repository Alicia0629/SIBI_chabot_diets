def calculate_kcal_to_mantein_weight(isMan:bool, age:int, sportLevel:int, weight:float, height:float) -> float: 
    """
    Calculates the daily caloric intake required to maintain the current weight
    based on the revised Harris-Benedict equations by Mifflin and St Jeor (1990).

    Parameters:
        isMan (bool): Indicates if the person is male (True) or female (False).
        age (int): The person's age in years.
        sportLevel (int): The person's activity level, where:
            - 1: Little or no exercise (TMB x 1.2)
            - 2: Light exercise (1-3 days per week, TMB x 1.375)
            - 3: Moderate exercise (3-5 days per week, TMB x 1.55)
            - 4: Intense exercise (6-7 days per week, TMB x 1.725)
            - 5: Very intense exercise (twice a day, hard training, TMB x 1.9).
        weight (float): The person's weight in kilograms.
        height (float): The person's height in centimeters.

    Returns:
        float: The total daily caloric intake required (in kcal) based on the
        Basal Metabolic Rate (TMB) and activity level.

    Formula:
        - For men: TMB = (10 x weight) + (6.25 x height) - (5 x age) + 5
        - For women: TMB = (10 x weight) + (6.25 x height) - (5 x age) - 161

    The calculated TMB is then multiplied by a factor based on `sportLevel` to determine
    the recommended daily caloric intake.
